Iris Species Detection System
Project Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a machine learning project designed to classify Iris flowers into their respective species. Using a classic dataset, the system trains various classification models to accurately predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements.

Problem Statement
The Iris dataset is a well-known benchmark in machine learning and serves as an excellent introduction to classification tasks. The goal of this project is to build a model that can distinguish between the three species of Iris flowers—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—given four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand the relationships and distributions of the dataset's features.
Model Implementation: Trains and compares the performance of multiple classification models.
Model Evaluation: Measures model effectiveness using accuracy scores and a confusion matrix.
Structured Workflow: A clear, step-by-step process from data loading to final model evaluation.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Core Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and loading the dataset.
scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization and plotting results.

Environment: Jupyter Notebooks for a reproducible and interactive workflow.

Dataset
The project uses the famous Iris dataset, which is readily available in scikit-learn. The dataset consists of 150 instances of Iris flowers, with 50 instances for each of the three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The features used for classification are:
sepal length
sepal width
petal length
petal width

Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning methodology for classification:

Data Loading and Preparation: The Iris dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations like scatter plots and pair plots are used to inspect the data and identify potential patterns that could help in classification.

Model Selection and Training: The following three classification algorithms were chosen and trained on the dataset:

Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary or multiclass classification.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on their nearest neighbors.
Decision Tree: A model that uses a tree-like structure to make decisions based on feature values.

Model Evaluation: Each model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and their accuracy scores are compared to determine the most effective classifier for this problem.
